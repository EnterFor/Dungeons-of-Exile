v.1.2.0
* Renamed mod to World of Exile
This is because I decided to expand the scope of the mod, from just dungeons, to the whole world, and even dimensions!
* Added Abyss Dimension
* Added blackstone tower structure, found in Abyss dimension
* Changed tower structure in overworld to jigsaw, won't ever float weirdly on mountains again.
* Chest at top of tower will get destroyed at end of tower destruction so it doesn't just hang there in air.
* Added locked treasure block, same as final treasure block, but doesn't start a tower destroying sequence!
* Locked and final treasure blocks now spawn a chest with a unique loot table
* added frost blaze
* added frost golem boss
* much better structure generation configs, now has a blacklist/whitelist of: dimensions, biomes and biome categories!
