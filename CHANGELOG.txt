v.1.2.0
* Renamed mod to World of Exile
This is because I decided to expand the scope of the mod, from just dungeons, to the whole world, and even dimensions!
* Changed tower structure in overworld to jigsaw, won't ever float weirdly on mountains again.
* Chest at top of tower will get destroyed at end of tower destruction so it doesn't just hang there in air.
* Added locked treasure block, same as final treasure block, but doesn't start a tower destroying sequence!
* Locked and final treasure blocks now spawn a chest with a unique loot table
* much better structure generation configs, now has a blacklist/whitelist of: dimensions, biomes and biome categories!

Added golem mobs!
These usually small but durable things will spawn randomly when you break blocks they are made of, like iron or stone.
Obsidian golems spawn when obsidian is created, and they are more tricky to deal with.
Most of them have special powers or things they do. Wood golems apply poison for example.
